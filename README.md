# SC3-plugins
UGens not in the general distribution that extend SuperCollider's sound pallette

Place in your SuperCollider/Extensions folder and reboot.  These files are meant to
extend SC3.9+ and won't work with previous systems.

The MacOS plugins are downloadable here.  For Windows/Linux find the binary files
here:  https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins/releases/tag/Version-3.9.0
